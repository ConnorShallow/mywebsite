    <h2>Ruminations on a Home Assistant Backend + Apple Homekit frontend for an Apple Family</h2>
    <p1>A great joy of home assistant is the sheer volume of personalization available to the user, contigent on their ability. Opposite to this ethos is Apple,
    who infantilizes their customers, but their impressive hardware competence keeps even the snarkiest of us quiet when it comes time to tap our 
    iPhone's at the Apple Store. Apple's limitations prevent many products from truly shining, for example, Lutron's Pico remotes firing off whatever
    sequence of events you desire.
