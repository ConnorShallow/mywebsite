    <h2>Ruminations on a Home Assistant Backend + Apple Homekit frontend for Apple Family</h2>
    <p1>A great joy of home assistant is the sheer volume of personalization available to the user, contigent on their ability. Opposite to this ethos is Apple,
    who infantilizes their customers, but impressive hardware competence keeps even the snarkiest of us quiet when it comes time to tap our iPhone's at the Apple Store.
